# WebSecService Security Considerations

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the WebSecService application.

## 1. Authentication

*   **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed using **bcrypt** via Laravel's built-in `Hash` facade.
*   **Password Policy**: A strong password policy is enforced during registration and password changes using Laravel's `Password` validation rule (minimum length, numbers, letters, mixed case, symbols, uncompromised check). See `app/Providers/SecurityServiceProvider.php`.
*   **Login Rate Limiting**: The standard login route (`/login`) is protected against brute-force attacks using custom rate limiting middleware (`rate.login`).
*   **Registration Throttling**: The registration route (`/register`) is throttled (`throttle:3,5`) to prevent abuse.
*   **Social Authentication (OAuth)**:
    *   Implemented using **Laravel Socialite** for Google, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
    *   Secure handling of OAuth callbacks and state parameter to prevent CSRF during the OAuth flow.
    *   Social login routes are rate-limited (`throttle:10,1`).
*   **Session Management**: Laravel's built-in session management is used, configured for security (e.g., secure cookies, session expiration).

## 2. Authorization

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented using the **Spatie Laravel Permission** package.
*   **Roles**: Predefined roles (Admin, Employee, Customer) with specific permissions.
*   **Permissions**: Granular permissions defined for actions (e.g., `edit_products`, `manage_orders`, `show_users`).
*   **Route Protection**: Middleware (`role:Admin|Employee`, `permission:some_permission`) is used in `routes/web.php` to protect routes based on roles and permissions.
*   **Controller/View Checks**: Authorization checks (`Auth::user()->hasRole()`, `Auth::user()->can()`, `@can` directive) are used within controllers and Blade views to enforce access control.

## 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

*   **Laravel Validation**: All incoming HTTP request data (forms, query parameters) is validated using Laravel's validation features (`$request->validate()`).
*   **Type Hinting**: PHP type hinting is used where appropriate.
*   **Custom Validation Rules**: A custom `no_script_tags` validation rule is registered in `SecurityServiceProvider.php` to prevent basic script injection attempts in specific fields.
*   **Eloquent Mass Assignment Protection**: Models use `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties to protect against mass assignment vulnerabilities.

## 4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention

*   **Blade Templating**: Laravel's Blade engine automatically escapes output using `{{ }}` syntax by default, preventing XSS vulnerabilities from rendered data.
*   **Input Sanitization**: The `no_script_tags` rule provides a basic layer of sanitization for specific inputs.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: *Recommendation: Implement a strict CSP header via middleware to further mitigate XSS risks.*

## 5. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

*   **Laravel Built-in**: The application utilizes Laravel's built-in CSRF protection.
*   **CSRF Token**: All `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` forms include a `@csrf` token, which is verified by the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware.

## 6. SQL Injection Prevention

*   **Eloquent ORM**: The primary method of database interaction is through Laravel's Eloquent ORM, which uses parameter binding via PDO, effectively preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities for standard queries.
*   **Query Builder**: When using Laravel's Query Builder, parameter binding is also used by default.
*   **Raw SQL Avoidance**: Direct use of raw SQL queries (`DB::raw()`) is minimized and carefully reviewed for potential vulnerabilities if used.

## 7. Security Headers

*   *Recommendation: Implement middleware to add crucial security headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, and `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`.*

## 8. Dependency Management

*   **Composer**: PHP dependencies are managed using Composer.
*   **Regular Updates**: Dependencies should be regularly updated (`composer update`) to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Audits**: *Recommendation: Periodically run `composer audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.*

## 9. Error Handling and Logging

*   **Detailed Logging**: Laravel is configured to log errors and events to `storage/logs/laravel.log`. Sensitive information is not logged by default.
*   **Debug Mode**: Debug mode (`APP_DEBUG=true`) is disabled in production environments to prevent exposure of sensitive error details.

## 10. Server Configuration

*   **HTTPS**: The application should always be served over HTTPS in production.
*   **File Permissions**: Web server file permissions should be configured securely to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
*   **.env File Security**: The `.env` file containing sensitive credentials should not be publicly accessible and excluded from version control.
