# TDR 004: Caching Choice

**Date**: 2025-xx-xx

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

To improve application performance and reduce database load, WebSecService requires a caching mechanism. This will be used for storing frequently accessed data, session information, and potentially queue jobs. The solution needs to integrate seamlessly with Laravel.

## Decision

We will use **Redis** as the primary caching driver and session driver for the application.

Laravel's cache and session configuration will be updated to use the `redis` driver. A running Redis server instance will be required.

## Consequences

**Positive**:

*   **Performance**: Redis is an in-memory data store, providing very fast read/write operations, significantly improving performance for cached data and sessions compared to file or database drivers.
*   **Laravel Integration**: Excellent first-party support in Laravel for caching, sessions, and queues.
*   **Versatility**: Can be used for caching, session management, queues, rate limiting, and more.
*   **Scalability**: Redis can be scaled effectively (e.g., using Redis Cluster).
*   **Atomic Operations**: Supports atomic operations, which are useful for tasks like rate limiting.

**Negative**:

*   **Memory Usage**: Being in-memory, Redis requires sufficient RAM, which can increase infrastructure costs.
*   **Persistence Configuration**: Requires careful configuration for data persistence if needed beyond a volatile cache (though often used primarily as a cache).
*   **Infrastructure Dependency**: Adds another service (Redis server) to manage and maintain in the infrastructure stack.
*   **Complexity**: Introduces concepts like cache invalidation strategies that need to be managed.
