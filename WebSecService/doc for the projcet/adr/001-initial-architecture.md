# ADR 001: Initial Architecture Choice

**Date**: 2025-xx-xx

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

We need to build a secure and scalable e-commerce web application (WebSecService). Key requirements include user authentication (multiple methods), role-based access control, product management, and an order processing system with a credit-based payment mechanism. The architecture must support standard web security practices and allow for future expansion.

## Decision

We will use the **Laravel framework (v10.x or later)** as the primary backend framework.

The key components of the architecture will be:

1.  **Backend Framework**: Laravel (PHP) - Provides MVC structure, ORM (Eloquent), routing, middleware, security features (CSRF, XSS protection via Blade), and a large ecosystem.
2.  **Frontend Framework**: Bootstrap (v5.x) - For responsive UI components and layout, integrated via Laravel Blade templates.
3.  **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB - A widely used relational database compatible with Laravel Eloquent.
4.  **Caching**: Redis - For performance optimization (session, cache).
5.  **Authentication**: Laravel's built-in system, extended with Laravel Socialite for OAuth and Spatie Laravel Permission for RBAC.
6.  **Web Server**: Standard PHP-compatible server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

## Consequences

**Positive**:

*   **Rapid Development**: Laravel's features and conventions accelerate development.
*   **Security**: Built-in protection against common web vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS via Blade).
*   **Scalability**: Laravel is designed for scalability, supported by features like caching and queues.
*   **Ecosystem**: Large number of packages available (Socialite, Spatie Permission) to add functionality quickly.
*   **Community Support**: Extensive documentation and active community.
*   **Maintainability**: MVC pattern promotes organized and maintainable code.

**Negative**:

*   **Learning Curve**: Requires familiarity with Laravel concepts.
*   **Server Requirements**: Needs a PHP-compatible hosting environment.
*   **Configuration**: Requires setup for database, cache (Redis), social providers, etc.
*   **Potential Overhead**: Full-stack framework might be overkill for very simple applications, but appropriate here.
