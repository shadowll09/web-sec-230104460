# TDR 001: Authentication and Authorization Implementation

**Date**: 2025-xx-xx

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

The WebSecService application requires a robust authentication and authorization system. Users need to log in via traditional email/password and social providers (Google, LinkedIn, Facebook). Access to different application features must be restricted based on user roles (Admin, Employee, Customer).

## Decision

We will implement authentication and authorization using the following combination of Laravel features and third-party packages:

1.  **Core Authentication**: Utilize Laravel's built-in authentication scaffolding (`laravel/ui` or Breeze/Jetstream if preferred later) for basic login, registration, password reset, and session management.
2.  **Social Authentication**: Integrate the **Laravel Socialite** package (`laravel/socialite`) to handle OAuth 2 flows for Google, LinkedIn, and Facebook logins.
3.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement the **Spatie Laravel Permission** package (`spatie/laravel-permission`) to manage roles (Admin, Employee, Customer) and assign permissions to these roles. Middleware provided by the package will be used to protect routes.
4.  **Password Security**: Enforce strong password policies using Laravel's built-in `Password` validation rule, configured in `SecurityServiceProvider`. Passwords will be hashed using bcrypt.
5.  **Rate Limiting**: Apply Laravel's built-in rate limiting middleware to login and registration routes to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Consequences

**Positive**:

*   **Leverages Standard Packages**: Uses well-maintained, widely adopted packages within the Laravel ecosystem.
*   **Simplified Implementation**: Socialite abstracts the complexities of OAuth flows. Spatie Laravel Permission provides a clear API for managing roles and permissions.
*   **Flexibility**: Spatie's package allows for granular control over permissions and easy assignment to roles or individual users.
*   **Security**: Built-in Laravel features and these packages follow security best practices.
*   **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns for authentication, social login, and authorization logic.

**Negative**:

*   **Configuration Overhead**: Requires setting up API keys and secrets for each social provider in the `.env` file and `config/services.php`.
*   **Database Structure**: Spatie Laravel Permission adds several tables to the database for roles, permissions, and their relationships.
*   **Dependency**: Introduces dependencies on external packages (Socialite, Spatie Permission).
*   **Complexity**: While simplifying, the combination of systems requires understanding how they interact (e.g., linking social profiles to user accounts, checking permissions in controllers/middleware/views).
