# TDR 002: Frontend Framework Choice

**Date**: 2025-xx-xx

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

The WebSecService application requires a responsive and consistent user interface across various devices. We need a frontend framework that integrates well with Laravel's Blade templating engine and offers pre-built components for rapid UI development.

## Decision

We will use **Bootstrap (v5.x)** as the primary frontend CSS framework.

Integration will be done via standard CSS/JS includes within the Laravel Blade layout files. Laravel's default Vite configuration (or Mix, depending on the Laravel version/setup) can be used for asset bundling.

## Consequences

**Positive**:

*   **Rapid Development**: Provides a wide range of pre-designed, responsive components (grids, forms, buttons, modals, navigation).
*   **Consistency**: Ensures a consistent look and feel across the application.
*   **Responsiveness**: Built-in responsive grid system simplifies layout for different screen sizes.
*   **Good Documentation**: Extensive documentation and examples available.
*   **Community Support**: Large community and widespread adoption.
*   **Integration**: Integrates easily with Laravel Blade templates.

**Negative**:

*   **Generic Look**: Can result in a generic appearance if not customized significantly.
*   **CSS Overhead**: Includes a potentially large CSS file, although customization and purging can mitigate this.
*   **Dependency**: Adds a dependency on the Bootstrap library.
*   **Potential Conflicts**: Custom CSS might conflict with Bootstrap styles if not managed carefully.
