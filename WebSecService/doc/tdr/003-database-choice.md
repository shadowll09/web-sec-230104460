# TDR 003: Database Choice

**Date**: 2025-xx-xx

**Status**: Accepted

## Context

The WebSecService application requires a persistent storage solution for user data, product information, orders, and other application state. The chosen database needs to be reliable, scalable, and well-supported by the Laravel framework.

## Decision

We will use **MySQL** as the primary relational database management system (RDBMS).

Laravel's Eloquent ORM will be used for interacting with the database, leveraging its features for migrations, seeding, and query building.

## Consequences

**Positive**:

*   **Laravel Compatibility**: Excellent first-party support within Laravel (Eloquent ORM, migrations, configuration).
*   **Widely Used**: Mature, well-documented, and widely adopted RDBMS.
*   **Relational Integrity**: Supports ACID transactions and enforces data integrity through relationships and constraints.
*   **Performance**: Generally good performance for typical web application workloads.
*   **Scalability**: Offers various scaling options (replication, clustering).
*   **Community & Tooling**: Large community support and numerous administration tools available.

**Negative**:

*   **Relational Constraints**: Can be less flexible than NoSQL databases for certain types of unstructured data (though not a primary requirement here).
*   **Scaling Complexity**: Horizontal scaling can be more complex than some NoSQL alternatives.
*   **Server Requirements**: Requires a running MySQL/MariaDB server instance.
